      <h1>Our Story</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>2024 — The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          CueLens began with a story I’ll never forget — the story of <strong>Anish</strong>, 
          a college graduate on the autism spectrum. While hanging out with friends, 
          he misread their teasing as friendly banter. When the tone shifted and they grew frustrated, 
          he couldn’t tell. One of them punched him in the face. 
          That moment stuck with me — not because of the violence, but because of the misunderstanding. 
          Anish didn’t lack empathy; he simply couldn’t read the cues.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized that communication breaks down not from a lack of emotion, 
          but from the absence of understanding. That was the spark that became CueLens.
        </p>

        <h2>First Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          My first prototype was inspired by the <strong>Stanford Autism Glass Project</strong>. 
          I built emotion-detecting glasses that used a small camera to identify facial expressions in real time 
          and relayed the emotion through headphones — effectively creating “emotional subtitles” for the world around you. 
          It was a scrappy build, but it proved the concept: technology could bridge the empathy gap.

        <h2>Startup Prep School</h2>
        <p>
          I applied to <strong>Santa Clara University’s Startup Prep School</strong> and became 
          the <strong>first high school student</strong> ever accepted into the accelerator. 
          There, I learned how to turn an idea into a scalable venture. 
          I conducted and organized <strong>over 50 interviews</strong> with autistic individuals, psychologists, 
          professors, and entrepreneurs. Listening to their stories shaped how CueLens could actually make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the program, our team competed in a national pitch competition — 
          and against college founders from across the country, we won <strong>$500</strong>! 
          That moment validated that the problem we were solving mattered.

        <h2>Redefining CueLens</h2>
        <p>
          By the end of the accelerator, I reimagined CueLens as an <strong>app that transcribes facial expressions 
          during video calls</strong> — providing emotional context in digital communication. 
          Over the summer, I worked with <strong>Mirro.ai</strong> to refine the model and deepen my understanding 
          of emotion-recognition AI and ethical dataset design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Global Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          In the months since, I’ve been collaborating with families, therapists, and autism centers 
          across <strong>three countries</strong> to make CueLens multilingual and culturally inclusive. 
          Because emotions — and how we express them — look different across every language and culture, 
          and a truly accessible AI must understand that diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          CueLens continues to grow with that mission: to make empathy more accessible, 
          one expression at a time.
